    # support edge weights.  Directed graphs are not supported.
    #
    # Data Structure
    # --------------
    #
    # Weights are stored in a 2D array.  The weight of an edge i,j
    # is stored twice, at `[i][j]` and `[j][i]`.
    #
    # Storing the weight twice wastes memory.  A symmetrical matrix
    # can be stored in a 1D array (http://bit.ly/1DMfLM3)
    # However, translating the 2D coordinates into a 1D index
    # marginally increases the cost of access, and this is a read-heavy
    # structure, so maybe the extra memory is an acceptable trade-off.
    # It's also conceptually simpler, for what that's worth.
    #
    # If directed graphs were supported (they are not) this 2D array
    # would be an obvious choice.
    #
    # Algorithms which operate on weighted graphs are tightly
    # coupled to this data structure due to optimizations.
